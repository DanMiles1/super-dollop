      "text": "The Data Science skill no one talks about...\n\nEvery aspiring data scientist I talk to thinks their job starts when someone else gives them:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1. a dataset, and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2. a clearly defined metric to optimize for, e.g. accuracy\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t.\n\nIt starts with a business problem you need to understand, frame, and solve. This is the key data science skill that separates senior from junior professionals.\n\nLet\u2019s go through an example.\n\nExample\n\nImagine you are a data scientist at Uber. And your product lead tells you:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udcbc: \u201cWe want to decrease user churn by 5% this quarter\u201d\n\nWe say that a user churns when she decides to stop using Uber.\n\nBut why?\n\nThere are different reasons why a user would stop using Uber. For example:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 1.\u00a0 \u201cLyft is offering better prices for that geo\u201d (pricing problem)\n\u00a0\u00a0 2. \u201cCar waiting times are too long\u201d (supply problem)\n\u00a0\u00a0 3. \u201cThe Android version of the app is very slow\u201d (client-app performance problem)\n\nYou build this list \u2191 by asking the right questions to the rest of the team. You need to understand the user\u2019s experience using the app, from HER point of view.\n\nTypically there is no single reason behind churn, but a combination of a few of these. The question is: which one should you focus on?\n\nThis is when you pull out your great data science skills and EXPLORE THE DATA \ud83d\udd0e.\n\nYou explore the data to understand how plausible each of the above explanations is. The output from this analysis is a single hypothesis you should consider further. Depending on the hypothesis, you will solve the data science problem differently.\n\nFor example\u2026\n\nScenario 1: \u201cLyft Is Offering Better Prices\u201d (Pricing Problem)\n\nOne solution would be to detect/predict the segment of users who are likely to churn (possibly using an ML Model) and send personalized discounts via push notifications. To test your solution works, you will need to run an A/B test, so you will split a percentage of Uber users into 2 groups:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The A group. No user in this group will receive any discount.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The B group. Users from this group that the model thinks are likely to churn, will receive a price discount in their next trip.\n\nYou could add more groups (e.g. C, D, E\u2026) to test different pricing points.\n\nIn a nutshell\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1. Translating business problems into data science problems is the key data science skill that separates a senior from a junior data scientist.\n2. Ask the right questions, list possible solutions, and explore the data to narrow down the list to one.\n3. Solve this one data science problem",

There are three main types:\n\n1. Supervised Learning: The algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, learning to map input to output. For example, it can predict housing prices based on features like size and location.\n\n2. Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm explores data patterns without explicit labels. Clustering is a common task, grouping similar data points. An example is customer segmentation for targeted marketing.\n\n3. Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment. It receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, improving its actions over time. Gaming AI and robotic control are applications.\n\nKey concepts include:\n\n- Features and Labels: Features are input variables, and labels are the desired output. The model learns to map features to labels during training.\n\n- Training and Testing: The model is trained on a subset of data and then tested on unseen data to evaluate its performance.\n\n- Overfitting and Underfitting: Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and fits the training data too closely, performing poorly on new data. Underfitting happens when the model is too simple and fails to capture the underlying patterns.\n\n- Algorithms: Different algorithms suit various tasks. Common ones include linear regression for predicting numerical values, and decision trees for classification tasks.\n\nIn summary, machine learning involves training models on data to make predictions or decisions. Supervised learning uses labeled data, unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data, and reinforcement learning learns through interaction with an environment. Key considerations include features, labels, overfitting, underfitting, and choosing the right algorithm for the task.\n\nJoin @datasciencefun for more \n\nENJOY LEARNING \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",

      "text": "Top 10 machine Learning algorithms \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\n\n1. Linear Regression: Linear regression is a simple and commonly used algorithm for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. It assumes a linear relationship between the input variables and the output.\n\n2. Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is used for binary classification problems where the target variable has two classes. It estimates the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class.\n\n3. Decision Trees: Decision trees are a popular algorithm for both classification and regression tasks. They partition the feature space into regions based on the input variables and make predictions by following a tree-like structure.\n\n4. Random Forest: Random forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy. It reduces overfitting and provides robust predictions by averaging the results of individual trees.\n\n5. Support Vector Machines (SVM): SVM is a powerful algorithm for both classification and regression tasks. It finds the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes in the feature space, maximizing the margin between classes.\n\n6. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): KNN is a simple and intuitive algorithm for classification and regression tasks. It makes predictions based on the similarity of input data points to their k nearest neighbors in the training set.\n\n7. Naive Bayes: Naive Bayes is a probabilistic algorithm based on Bayes' theorem that is commonly used for classification tasks. It assumes that the features are conditionally independent given the class label.\n\n8. Neural Networks: Neural networks are a versatile and powerful class of algorithms inspired by the human brain. They consist of interconnected layers of neurons that learn complex patterns in the data through training.\n\n9. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): GBM is an ensemble learning method that builds a series of weak learners sequentially to improve prediction accuracy. It combines multiple decision trees in a boosting framework to minimize prediction errors.\n\n10. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving as much variance as possible. It helps in visualizing and understanding the underlying structure of the data.\n\nCredits: https://t.me/datasciencefun\n\nLike if you need similar content \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\udc4d\n\nHope this helps you \ud83d\ude0a",
