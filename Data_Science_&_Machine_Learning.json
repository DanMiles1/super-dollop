      "text": "The Data Science skill no one talks about...\n\nEvery aspiring data scientist I talk to thinks their job starts when someone else gives them:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1. a dataset, and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2. a clearly defined metric to optimize for, e.g. accuracy\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t.\n\nIt starts with a business problem you need to understand, frame, and solve. This is the key data science skill that separates senior from junior professionals.\n\nLet\u2019s go through an example.\n\nExample\n\nImagine you are a data scientist at Uber. And your product lead tells you:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udcbc: \u201cWe want to decrease user churn by 5% this quarter\u201d\n\nWe say that a user churns when she decides to stop using Uber.\n\nBut why?\n\nThere are different reasons why a user would stop using Uber. For example:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 1.\u00a0 \u201cLyft is offering better prices for that geo\u201d (pricing problem)\n\u00a0\u00a0 2. \u201cCar waiting times are too long\u201d (supply problem)\n\u00a0\u00a0 3. \u201cThe Android version of the app is very slow\u201d (client-app performance problem)\n\nYou build this list \u2191 by asking the right questions to the rest of the team. You need to understand the user\u2019s experience using the app, from HER point of view.\n\nTypically there is no single reason behind churn, but a combination of a few of these. The question is: which one should you focus on?\n\nThis is when you pull out your great data science skills and EXPLORE THE DATA \ud83d\udd0e.\n\nYou explore the data to understand how plausible each of the above explanations is. The output from this analysis is a single hypothesis you should consider further. Depending on the hypothesis, you will solve the data science problem differently.\n\nFor example\u2026\n\nScenario 1: \u201cLyft Is Offering Better Prices\u201d (Pricing Problem)\n\nOne solution would be to detect/predict the segment of users who are likely to churn (possibly using an ML Model) and send personalized discounts via push notifications. To test your solution works, you will need to run an A/B test, so you will split a percentage of Uber users into 2 groups:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The A group. No user in this group will receive any discount.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The B group. Users from this group that the model thinks are likely to churn, will receive a price discount in their next trip.\n\nYou could add more groups (e.g. C, D, E\u2026) to test different pricing points.\n\nIn a nutshell\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1. Translating business problems into data science problems is the key data science skill that separates a senior from a junior data scientist.\n2. Ask the right questions, list possible solutions, and explore the data to narrow down the list to one.\n3. Solve this one data science problem",

There are three main types:\n\n1. Supervised Learning: The algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, learning to map input to output. For example, it can predict housing prices based on features like size and location.\n\n2. Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm explores data patterns without explicit labels. Clustering is a common task, grouping similar data points. An example is customer segmentation for targeted marketing.\n\n3. Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment. It receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, improving its actions over time. Gaming AI and robotic control are applications.\n\nKey concepts include:\n\n- Features and Labels: Features are input variables, and labels are the desired output. The model learns to map features to labels during training.\n\n- Training and Testing: The model is trained on a subset of data and then tested on unseen data to evaluate its performance.\n\n- Overfitting and Underfitting: Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and fits the training data too closely, performing poorly on new data. Underfitting happens when the model is too simple and fails to capture the underlying patterns.\n\n- Algorithms: Different algorithms suit various tasks. Common ones include linear regression for predicting numerical values, and decision trees for classification tasks.\n\nIn summary, machine learning involves training models on data to make predictions or decisions. Supervised learning uses labeled data, unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data, and reinforcement learning learns through interaction with an environment. Key considerations include features, labels, overfitting, underfitting, and choosing the right algorithm for the task.\n\nJoin @datasciencefun for more \n\nENJOY LEARNING \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",

Linear Regression: Linear regression is a simple and commonly used algorithm for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. It assumes a linear relationship between the input variables and the output.\n\n2. Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is used for binary classification problems where the target variable has two classes. It estimates the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class.\n\n3. Decision Trees: Decision trees are a popular algorithm for both classification and regression tasks. They partition the feature space into regions based on the input variables and make predictions by following a tree-like structure.\n\n4. Random Forest: Random forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy. It reduces overfitting and provides robust predictions by averaging the results of individual trees.\n\n5. Support Vector Machines (SVM): SVM is a powerful algorithm for both classification and regression tasks. It finds the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes in the feature space, maximizing the margin between classes.\n\n6. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): KNN is a simple and intuitive algorithm for classification and regression tasks. It makes predictions based on the similarity of input data points to their k nearest neighbors in the training set.\n\n7. Naive Bayes: Naive Bayes is a probabilistic algorithm based on Bayes' theorem that is commonly used for classification tasks. It assumes that the features are conditionally independent given the class label.\n\n8. Neural Networks: Neural networks are a versatile and powerful class of algorithms inspired by the human brain. They consist of interconnected layers of neurons that learn complex patterns in the data through training.\n\n9. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): GBM is an ensemble learning method that builds a series of weak learners sequentially to improve prediction accuracy. It combines multiple decision trees in a boosting framework to minimize prediction errors.\n\n10. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving as much variance as possible. It helps in visualizing and understanding the underlying structure of the data.\n\nCredits: https://t.me/datasciencefun\n\nLike if you need similar content \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\udc4d\n\nHope this helps you \ud83d\ude0a",

      "text": "Industry Data Science vs Academia Data Science\n\nComparing Data Science in academia and Data Science in industry is like comparing tennis with table tennis: they sound similar but in the end, they are completely different! \n\n5 big differences between Data Science in academia and in industry \ud83d\udc47: \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Model vs Data: Academia focuses on models, industry focuses on data. In academia, it\u2019s all about trying to find the best model architecture to optimise a defined metric. In industry, loading and processing the data accounts for around 80% of the job.  \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Novelty vs Efficiency: The end goal of academia is often to publish a paper and to do so, you will need to find and implement a novel approach. Industry is all about efficiency: reusing existing models as much as possible and applying them to your use case. \n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Complex vs Simple: More often than not, academia requires complex solutions. I know that this isn\u2019t always the case but unfortunately, complex papers get a higher chance of being accepted at top conferences. In industry, it\u2019s all about simplicity: trying to find the simplest solution that solves a specific problem. \n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Theory vs Engineering: To succeed in academia, you need to have strong theoretical and maths skills. To succeed in industry, you need to develop strong engineering skills. It is great to be able to train a model in a notebook but if you cannot deploy your model in production, it will be completely useless. \n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Knowledge impact vs $ impact: In academia, it\u2019s all about creating new work and expanding human knowledge. In industry, it is all about using data to drive value and increase revenue.",

ML Algorithms can be categorized into three types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.\n\n1. Supervised Learning:\n    - Definition: Algorithms learn from labeled training data, making predictions or decisions based on input-output pairs.\n    - Examples: Linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks.\n    - Applications: Email spam detection, image recognition, and medical diagnosis.\n\n2. Unsupervised Learning:\n    - Definition: Algorithms analyze and group unlabeled data, identifying patterns and structures without prior knowledge of the outcomes.\n    - Examples: K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA).\n    - Applications: Customer segmentation, market basket analysis, and anomaly detection.\n\n3. Reinforcement Learning:\n    - Definition: Algorithms learn by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties based on their actions, and optimizing for long-term goals.\n    - Examples: Q-learning, deep Q-networks (DQN), and policy gradient methods.\n    - Applications: Robotics, game playing (like AlphaGo), and self-driving cars.\n\nBest Data Science & Machine Learning Resources: https://topmate.io/coding/914624\n\nCredits: https://t.me/datasciencefun\n\nLike if you need similar content \n\nENJOY LEARNING \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",

      "text": "Are you looking to become a machine learning engineer? The algorithm brought you to the right place! \ud83d\udccc\n\nI created a free and comprehensive roadmap. Let's go through this thread and explore what you need to know to become an expert machine learning engineer:\n\nMath & Statistics\n\nJust like most other data roles, machine learning engineering starts with strong foundations from math, precisely linear algebra, probability and statistics. \n\nHere are the probability units you will need to focus on: \n\nBasic probability concepts statistics\nInferential statistics\nRegression analysis \nExperimental design and A/B testing Bayesian statistics\nCalculus\nLinear algebra\n\nPython:\n\nYou can choose Python, R, Julia, or any other language, but Python is the most versatile and flexible language for machine learning.\n\nVariables, data types, and basic operations\nControl flow statements (e.g., if-else, loops)\nFunctions and modules\nError handling and exceptions\nBasic data structures (e.g., lists, dictionaries, tuples)\nObject-oriented programming concepts\nBasic work with APIs\nDetailed data structures and algorithmic thinking\n\nMachine Learning Prerequisites:\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with NumPy and Pandas\nBasic data visualization techniques to visualize the variables and features.\nFeature extraction\nFeature engineering\nDifferent types of encoding data\n\nMachine Learning Fundamentals\n\nUsing scikit-learn library in combination with other Python libraries for:\n\nSupervised Learning: (Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees)\nUnsupervised Learning: (K-Means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis, Hierarchical Clustering)\nReinforcement Learning: (Q-Learning, Deep Q Network, Policy Gradients)\n\nSolving two types of problems:\nRegression\nClassification\n\nNeural Networks:\nNeural networks are like computer brains that learn from examples, made up of layers of \"neurons\" that handle data. They learn without explicit instructions.\n\nTypes of Neural Networks:\n\nFeedforward Neural Networks: Simplest form, with straight connections and no loops.\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Great for images, learning visual patterns.\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Good for sequences like text or time series, because they remember past information.\n\nIn Python, it\u2019s the best to use TensorFlow and Keras libraries, as well as PyTorch, for deeper and more complex neural network systems.\n\nDeep Learning:\n\nDeep learning is a subset of machine learning in artificial intelligence (AI) that has networks capable of learning unsupervised from data that is unstructured or unlabeled.\n\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)\nLong Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs)\nAutoencoders\nDeep Belief Networks (DBNs)\nTransformer Models\n\nMachine Learning Project Deployment\n\nMachine learning engineers should also be able to dive into MLOps and project deployment. Here are the things that you should be familiar or skilled at:\n\nVersion Control for Data and Models\nAutomated Testing and Continuous Integration (CI)\nContinuous Delivery and Deployment (CD)\nMonitoring and Logging\nExperiment Tracking and Management\nFeature Stores\nData Pipeline and Workflow Orchestration\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC)\nModel Serving and APIs\n\nBest Data Science & Machine Learning Resources: https://topmate.io/coding/914624\n\nCredits: https://t.me/datasciencefun\n\nLike if you need similar content \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\udc4d\n\nHope this helps you \ud83d\ude0a",

      "text": "Industry Data Science vs Academia Data Science\n\nComparing Data Science in academia and Data Science in industry is like comparing tennis with table tennis: they sound similar but in the end, they are completely different! \n\n5 big differences between Data Science in academia and in industry \ud83d\udc47: \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Model vs Data: Academia focuses on models, industry focuses on data. In academia, it\u2019s all about trying to find the best model architecture to optimise a defined metric. In industry, loading and processing the data accounts for around 80% of the job.  \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Novelty vs Efficiency: The end goal of academia is often to publish a paper and to do so, you will need to find and implement a novel approach. Industry is all about efficiency: reusing existing models as much as possible and applying them to your use case. \n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Complex vs Simple: More often than not, academia requires complex solutions. I know that this isn\u2019t always the case but unfortunately, complex papers get a higher chance of being accepted at top conferences. In industry, it\u2019s all about simplicity: trying to find the simplest solution that solves a specific problem. \n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Theory vs Engineering: To succeed in academia, you need to have strong theoretical and maths skills. To succeed in industry, you need to develop strong engineering skills. It is great to be able to train a model in a notebook but if you cannot deploy your model in production, it will be completely useless. \n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Knowledge impact vs $ impact: In academia, it\u2019s all about creating new work and expanding human knowledge. In industry, it is all about using data to drive value and increase revenue.",

      "text": "Top 10 important data science concepts\n\n1. Data Cleaning: Data cleaning is the process of identifying and correcting or removing errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in a dataset. It is a crucial step in the data science pipeline as it ensures the quality and reliability of the data.\n\n2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA is the process of analyzing and visualizing data to gain insights and understand the underlying patterns and relationships. It involves techniques such as summary statistics, data visualization, and correlation analysis.\n\n3. Feature Engineering: Feature engineering is the process of creating new features or transforming existing features in a dataset to improve the performance of machine learning models. It involves techniques such as encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical variables, and creating interaction terms.\n\n4. Machine Learning Algorithms: Machine learning algorithms are mathematical models that learn patterns and relationships from data to make predictions or decisions. Some important machine learning algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks.\n\n5. Model Evaluation and Validation: Model evaluation and validation involve assessing the performance of machine learning models on unseen data. It includes techniques such as cross-validation, confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curve analysis.\n\n6. Feature Selection: Feature selection is the process of selecting the most relevant features from a dataset to improve model performance and reduce overfitting. It involves techniques such as correlation analysis, backward elimination, forward selection, and regularization methods.\n\n7. Dimensionality Reduction: Dimensionality reduction techniques are used to reduce the number of features in a dataset while preserving the most important information. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) are common dimensionality reduction techniques.\n\n8. Model Optimization: Model optimization involves fine-tuning the parameters and hyperparameters of machine learning models to achieve the best performance. Techniques such as grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization are used for model optimization.\n\n9. Data Visualization: Data visualization is the graphical representation of data to communicate insights and patterns effectively. It involves using charts, graphs, and plots to present data in a visually appealing and understandable manner.\n\n10. Big Data Analytics: Big data analytics refers to the process of analyzing large and complex datasets that cannot be processed using traditional data processing techniques. It involves technologies such as Hadoop, Spark, and distributed computing to extract insights from massive amounts of data.\n\nBest Data Science & Machine Learning Resources: https://topmate.io/coding/914624\n\nCredits: https://t.me/datasciencefun\n\nLike if you need similar content \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\udc4d\n\nHope this helps you \ud83d\ude0a",

Let's go through this thread and explore what you need to know to become an expert machine learning engineer:\n\nMath & Statistics\n\nJust like most other data roles, machine learning engineering starts with strong foundations from math, precisely linear algebra, probability and statistics. \n\nHere are the probability units you will need to focus on: \n\nBasic probability concepts statistics\nInferential statistics\nRegression analysis \nExperimental design and A/B testing Bayesian statistics\nCalculus\nLinear algebra\n\nPython:\n\nYou can choose Python, R, Julia, or any other language, but Python is the most versatile and flexible language for machine learning.\n\nVariables, data types, and basic operations\nControl flow statements (e.g., if-else, loops)\nFunctions and modules\nError handling and exceptions\nBasic data structures (e.g., lists, dictionaries, tuples)\nObject-oriented programming concepts\nBasic work with APIs\nDetailed data structures and algorithmic thinking\n\nMachine Learning Prerequisites:\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with NumPy and Pandas\nBasic data visualization techniques to visualize the variables and features.\nFeature extraction\nFeature engineering\nDifferent types of encoding data\n\nMachine Learning Fundamentals\n\nUsing scikit-learn library in combination with other Python libraries for:\n\nSupervised Learning: (Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees)\nUnsupervised Learning: (K-Means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis, Hierarchical Clustering)\nReinforcement Learning: (Q-Learning, Deep Q Network, Policy Gradients)\n\nSolving two types of problems:\nRegression\nClassification\n\nNeural Networks:\nNeural networks are like computer brains that learn from examples, made up of layers of \"neurons\" that handle data. They learn without explicit instructions.\n\nTypes of Neural Networks:\n\nFeedforward Neural Networks: Simplest form, with straight connections and no loops.\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Great for images, learning visual patterns.\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Good for sequences like text or time series, because they remember past information.\n\nIn Python, it\u2019s the best to use TensorFlow and Keras libraries, as well as PyTorch, for deeper and more complex neural network systems.\n\nDeep Learning:\n\nDeep learning is a subset of machine learning in artificial intelligence (AI) that has networks capable of learning unsupervised from data that is unstructured or unlabeled.\n\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)\nLong Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs)\nAutoencoders\nDeep Belief Networks (DBNs)\nTransformer Models\n\nMachine Learning Project Deployment\n\nMachine learning engineers should also be able to dive into MLOps and project deployment. Here are the things that you should be familiar or skilled at:\n\nVersion Control for Data and Models\nAutomated Testing and Continuous Integration (CI)\nContinuous Delivery and Deployment (CD)\nMonitoring and Logging\nExperiment Tracking and Management\nFeature Stores\nData Pipeline and Workflow Orchestration\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC)\nModel Serving and APIs\n\nBest Data Science & Machine Learning Resources: https://topmate.io/coding/914624\n\nCredits: https://t.me/datasciencefun\n\nLike if you need similar content \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\udc4d\n\nHope this helps you \ud83d\ude0a",

It is like an artificial human nervous system for receiving, processing, and transmitting information in terms of Computer Science.\n\nBasically, there are 3 different layers in a neural network :\n\nInput Layer (All the inputs are fed in the model through this layer)\n\nHidden Layers (There can be more than one hidden layers which are used for processing the inputs received from the input layers)\n\nOutput Layer (The data after processing is made available at the output layer)\n\nGraph data can be used with a lot of learning tasks contain a lot rich relation data among elements. For example, modeling physics system, predicting protein interface, and classifying diseases require that a model learns from graph inputs. Graph reasoning models can also be used for learning from non-structural data like texts and images and reasoning on extracted structures.",

      "text": "The Data Science skill no one talks about...\n\nEvery aspiring data scientist I talk to thinks their job starts when someone else gives them:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1. a dataset, and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2. a clearly defined metric to optimize for, e.g. accuracy\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t.\n\nIt starts with a business problem you need to understand, frame, and solve. This is the key data science skill that separates senior from junior professionals.\n\nLet\u2019s go through an example.\n\nExample\n\nImagine you are a data scientist at Uber. And your product lead tells you:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udcbc: \u201cWe want to decrease user churn by 5% this quarter\u201d\n\nWe say that a user churns when she decides to stop using Uber.\n\nBut why?\n\nThere are different reasons why a user would stop using Uber. For example:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 1.\u00a0 \u201cLyft is offering better prices for that geo\u201d (pricing problem)\n\u00a0\u00a0 2. \u201cCar waiting times are too long\u201d (supply problem)\n\u00a0\u00a0 3. \u201cThe Android version of the app is very slow\u201d (client-app performance problem)\n\nYou build this list \u2191 by asking the right questions to the rest of the team. You need to understand the user\u2019s experience using the app, from HER point of view.\n\nTypically there is no single reason behind churn, but a combination of a few of these. The question is: which one should you focus on?\n\nThis is when you pull out your great data science skills and EXPLORE THE DATA \ud83d\udd0e.\n\nYou explore the data to understand how plausible each of the above explanations is. The output from this analysis is a single hypothesis you should consider further. Depending on the hypothesis, you will solve the data science problem differently.\n\nFor example\u2026\n\nScenario 1: \u201cLyft Is Offering Better Prices\u201d (Pricing Problem)\n\nOne solution would be to detect/predict the segment of users who are likely to churn (possibly using an ML Model) and send personalized discounts via push notifications. To test your solution works, you will need to run an A/B test, so you will split a percentage of Uber users into 2 groups:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The A group. No user in this group will receive any discount.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The B group. Users from this group that the model thinks are likely to churn, will receive a price discount in their next trip.\n\nYou could add more groups (e.g. C, D, E\u2026) to test different pricing points.\n\nIn a nutshell\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1. Translating business problems into data science problems is the key data science skill that separates a senior from a junior data scientist.\n2. Ask the right questions, list possible solutions, and explore the data to narrow down the list to one.\n3. Solve this one data science problem",

      "text": "10 commonly asked data science interview questions along with their answers\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?\nSupervised learning involves learning from labeled data to predict outcomes while unsupervised learning involves finding patterns in unlabeled data.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Explain the bias-variance tradeoff in machine learning.\nThe bias-variance tradeoff is a key concept in machine learning. Models with high bias have low complexity and over-simplify, while models with high variance are more complex and over-fit to the training data. The goal is to find the right balance between bias and variance.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 What is the Central Limit Theorem and why is it important in statistics?\nThe Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that the sampling distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed regardless of the underlying population distribution, as long as the sample size is sufficiently large. It is important because it justifies the use of statistics, such as hypothesis testing and confidence intervals, on small sample sizes.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Describe the process of feature selection and why it is important in machine learning.\nFeature selection is the process of selecting the most relevant features (variables) from a dataset. This is important because unnecessary features can lead to over-fitting, slower training times, and reduced accuracy.\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 What is the difference between overfitting and underfitting in machine learning? How do you address them?\nOverfitting occurs when a model is too complex and fits the training data too well, resulting in poor performance on unseen data. Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple and cannot fit the training data well enough, resulting in poor performance on both training and unseen data. Techniques to address overfitting include regularization and early stopping, while techniques to address underfitting include using more complex models or increasing the amount of input data.\n\n6\ufe0f\u20e3 What is regularization and why is it used in machine learning?\nRegularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in machine learning. It involves adding a penalty term to the loss function to limit the complexity of the model, effectively reducing the impact of certain features.\n\n7\ufe0f\u20e3 How do you handle missing data in a dataset?\nHandling missing data can be done by either deleting the missing samples, imputing the missing values, or using models that can handle missing data directly.\n\n8\ufe0f\u20e3 What is the difference between classification and regression in machine learning?\nClassification is a type of supervised learning where the goal is to predict a categorical or discrete outcome, while regression is a type of supervised learning where the goal is to predict a continuous or numerical outcome.\n\n9\ufe0f\u20e3 Explain the concept of cross-validation and why it is used.\nCross-validation is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model. It involves spliting the data into training and validation sets, and then training and evaluating the model on multiple such splits. Cross-validation gives a better idea of the model's generalization ability and helps prevent over-fitting.\n\n\ud83d\udd1f What evaluation metrics would you use to evaluate a binary classification model?\nSome commonly used evaluation metrics for binary classification models are accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC. The choice of metric depends on the specific requirements of the problem.\n\nBest Data Science & Machine Learning Resources: https://topmate.io/coding/914624\n\nCredits: https://t.me/datasciencefun\n\nLike if you need similar content \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\udc4d\n\nHope this helps you \ud83d\ude0a",

Data scientists often work in teams, collaborating with engineers, product managers, and business analysts \n\n\u2705 Data Science is All About Big Data\n\nBig data is a big buzzword (that was more popular 10 years ago), but not all data science projects involve massive datasets. It\u2019s about the quality of the data and the questions you\u2019re asking, not just the quantity.\n\n\u2705 You Need to Be a Math Genius\n\nMany data science problems can be solved with basic statistical methods and simple logistic regression. It\u2019s more about applying the right techniques rather than knowing advanced math theories.\n\n\u2705 Data Science is All About Algorithms\n\nAlgorithms are a big part of data science, but understanding the data and the business problem is equally important. Choosing the right algorithm is crucial, but it\u2019s not just about complex models. Sometimes simple models can provide the best results. Logistic regression!",

The training process continues until the model achieves a desired level of accuracy on the training data.\n\nExample problems are classification and regression.\n\nExample algorithms include: Logistic Regression and the Back Propagation Neural Network.\n\n2. Unsupervised Learning\n\nInput data is not labeled and does not have a known result.\n\nA model is prepared by deducing structures present in the input data. This may be to extract general rules. It may be through a mathematical process to systematically reduce redundancy, or it may be to\u00a0organize\u00a0data by similarity.\n\nExample problems are clustering, dimensionality reduction and association rule learning.\n\nExample algorithms include: the Apriori algorithm and K-Means.\n\n3. Semi-Supervised Learning\n\nInput data is a mixture of labeled and unlabelled examples.\n\nThere is a desired prediction problem but the model must learn the structures to organize the data as well as make predictions.\n\nExample problems are classification and regression.\n\nExample algorithms are extensions to other flexible methods that make assumptions about how to model the unlabeled data.",

Twitter could leverage user interactions to recommend tweets, users, or topics.\n\n\n3: Write a Python or Scala function to count the frequency of hashtags in a given collection of tweets.\n\n- Answer (Python):\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 def count_hashtags(tweet_collection):\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 hashtags_count = {}\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 for tweet in tweet_collection:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 hashtags = [word for word in tweet.split() if word.startswith('#')]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 for hashtag in hashtags:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 hashtags_count[hashtag] = hashtags_count.get(hashtag, 0) + 1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 return hashtags_count\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n4: How does graph analysis contribute to understanding user interactions and content propagation on Twitter? Provide a specific use case.\n\n- Answer: Graph analysis on Twitter involves examining user interactions. For instance, identifying influential users or detecting communities based on retweet or mention networks. Algorithms like PageRank or Louvain Modularity can aid in these analyses.\n\nI have curated the best interview resources to crack Data Science Interviews \n\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\nhttps://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va8v3eo1NCrQfGMseL2D\n\nLike if you need similar content \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\udc4d",

      "text": "Time Complexity of 10 Most Popular ML Algorithms\n\nWhen selecting a machine learning model, understanding its time complexity is crucial for efficient processing, especially with large datasets.\n\nFor instance,\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Linear Regression (OLS) is computationally expensive due to matrix multiplication, making it less suitable for big data applications.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Logistic Regression with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) offers faster training times by updating parameters iteratively.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Decision Trees and Random Forests are efficient for training but can be slower for prediction due to traversing the tree structure.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) is simple but can become slow with large datasets due to distance calculations.\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Naive Bayes is fast and scalable, making it suitable for large datasets with high-dimensional features.\n\n6\ufe0f\u20e3 Support Vector Machines (SVMs) \u2013 Training an SVM with a linear kernel has a time complexity of O(n\u00b2), while non-linear kernels (like RBF) can take O(n\u00b3), making them slow for large datasets. However, linear SVMs work well for high-dimensional but sparse data.\n\n7\ufe0f\u20e3 K-Means Clustering \u2013 The standard Lloyd\u2019s algorithm has a time complexity of O(n * k * i * d), where n is the number of data points, k is the number of clusters, i is the number of iterations, and d is the number of dimensions. Convergence speed depends on initialization methods.\n\n8\ufe0f\u20e3 Principal Component Analysis (PCA) \u2013 PCA involves eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrix, leading to a time complexity of O(d\u00b3) + O(n * d\u00b2). It becomes computationally expensive for very high-dimensional data.\n\n9\ufe0f\u20e3 Neural Networks (Deep Learning) \u2013 The training complexity varies based on architecture but typically falls in the range of O(n * d * h) per iteration, where h is the number of hidden units. Large networks require GPUs or TPUs for efficient training.\n\n\ud83d\udd1f Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) \u2013 Training complexity is O(n * d * log(n)) per iteration, making it slower than decision trees but highly efficient with optimizations like histogram-based learning.\nUnderstanding these complexities helps in choosing the right algorithm based on dataset size, feature dimensions, and computational resources. \ud83d\ude80",

      "text": "Now let's understand Linear Regression in detail.\n\nLinear Regression is all about predicting a continuous value (like salary, price, temperature) based on another variable (like years of experience, number of products sold, etc.).\n\nLet's say, You\u2019re trying to predict someone's salary based on their years of experience. As experience increases, you generally expect the salary to increase too. What linear regression does is find the best line that fits this trend.\n\nThe line is represented by this simple equation:\n\nSalary = m * Years of Experience + b\n\nHere:\nm is the slope of the line (it tells you how much salary increases with each additional year of experience).\nb is the y-intercept (the starting point, or the salary when there's no experience).\n\nThe Process:\n\nTraining the model: The algorithm looks at all your data and tries to draw the straightest line possible that fits the pattern between experience and salary. It does this by adjusting the m (slope) and b (intercept) to minimize the difference between predicted and actual salaries.\n\nMaking predictions: Once the model has learned the best line, it can predict salaries for new people based on their years of experience. For example, if you tell it someone has 5 years of experience, it will give you the predicted salary.\n\nLinear regression is great when there's a straight-line relationship between variables. It helps you make predictions, and because it\u2019s simple, it\u2019s often used as a starting point for many problems.\n\nReact with \u2665\ufe0f if you need similar explanation for the rest of the algorithms",

      "text": "10 Machine Learning Concepts You Must Know\n\n1. Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning\n\nSupervised Learning involves training a model on labeled data (input-output pairs). Examples: Linear Regression, Classification.\n\nUnsupervised Learning deals with unlabeled data. The model tries to find hidden patterns or groupings. Examples: Clustering (K-Means), Dimensionality Reduction (PCA).\n\n\n2. Bias-Variance Tradeoff\n\nBias is the error due to overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm.\n\nVariance is the error due to excessive sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training data.\n\nGoal: Minimize both for optimal model performance. High bias \u2192 underfitting; High variance \u2192 overfitting.\n\n\n3. Feature Engineering\n\nThe process of selecting, transforming, and creating variables (features) to improve model performance.\n\nExamples: Normalization, encoding categorical variables, creating interaction terms, handling missing data.\n\n\n4. Train-Test Split & Cross-Validation\n\nTrain-Test Split divides the dataset into training and testing subsets to evaluate model generalization.\n\nCross-Validation (e.g., k-fold) provides a more reliable evaluation by splitting data into k subsets and training/testing on each.\n\n\n5. Confusion Matrix\n\nA performance evaluation tool for classification models showing TP, TN, FP, FN.\n\nFrom it, we derive:\n\nAccuracy = (TP + TN) / Total\n\nPrecision = TP / (TP + FP)\n\nRecall = TP / (TP + FN)\n\nF1 Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)\n\n\n\n6. Gradient Descent\n\nAn optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost/loss function by iteratively updating model parameters in the direction of the negative gradient.\n\nVariants: Batch GD, Stochastic GD (SGD), Mini-batch GD.\n\n\n7. Regularization (L1/L2)\n\nTechniques to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function.\n\nL1 (Lasso): Adds absolute value of coefficients, can shrink some to zero (feature selection).\n\nL2 (Ridge): Adds square of coefficients, tends to shrink but not eliminate coefficients.\n\n\n8. Decision Trees & Random Forests\n\nDecision Tree: A tree-structured model that splits data based on features. Easy to interpret.\n\nRandom Forest: An ensemble of decision trees; reduces overfitting and improves accuracy.\n\n\n9. Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n\nA supervised learning algorithm used for classification. It finds the optimal hyperplane that separates classes.\n\nUses kernels (linear, polynomial, RBF) to handle non-linearly separable data.\n\n\n10. Neural Networks\n\nInspired by the human brain, these consist of layers of interconnected neurons.\n\nDeep Neural Networks (DNNs) can model complex patterns.\n\nThe backbone of deep learning applications like image recognition, NLP, etc.",

      "text": "Basics of Machine Learning \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\n\nMachine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence where computers learn from data to make decisions without explicit programming. There are three main types:\n\n1. Supervised Learning: The algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, learning to map input to output. For example, it can predict housing prices based on features like size and location.\n\n2. Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm explores data patterns without explicit labels. Clustering is a common task, grouping similar data points. An example is customer segmentation for targeted marketing.\n\n3. Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment. It receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, improving its actions over time. Gaming AI and robotic control are applications.\n\nKey concepts include:\n\n- Features and Labels: Features are input variables, and labels are the desired output. The model learns to map features to labels during training.\n\n- Training and Testing: The model is trained on a subset of data and then tested on unseen data to evaluate its performance.\n\n- Overfitting and Underfitting: Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and fits the training data too closely, performing poorly on new data. Underfitting happens when the model is too simple and fails to capture the underlying patterns.\n\n- Algorithms: Different algorithms suit various tasks. Common ones include linear regression for predicting numerical values, and decision trees for classification tasks.\n\nIn summary, machine learning involves training models on data to make predictions or decisions. Supervised learning uses labeled data, unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data, and reinforcement learning learns through interaction with an environment. Key considerations include features, labels, overfitting, underfitting, and choosing the right algorithm for the task.\n\nENJOY LEARNING \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",

      "text": "Some useful PYTHON libraries for data science\n\nNumPy\u00a0stands for Numerical Python. The most powerful feature of NumPy is n-dimensional array. This library also contains basic linear algebra functions, Fourier transforms, \u00a0advanced random number capabilities and tools for integration with other low level languages like Fortran, C and C++\n\nSciPy\u00a0stands for Scientific Python. SciPy is built on NumPy. It is one of the most useful library for variety of high level science and engineering modules like discrete Fourier transform, Linear Algebra, Optimization and Sparse matrices.\n\nMatplotlib\u00a0for plotting vast variety of graphs, starting from histograms to line plots to heat plots.. You can use Pylab feature in ipython notebook (ipython notebook \u2013pylab = inline) to use these plotting features inline. If you ignore the inline option, then pylab converts ipython environment to an environment, very similar to Matlab. You can also use Latex commands to add math to your plot.\n\nPandas\u00a0for structured data operations and manipulations. It is extensively used for data munging and preparation. Pandas were added relatively recently to Python and have been instrumental in boosting Python\u2019s usage in data scientist community.\n\nScikit Learn\u00a0for\u00a0machine learning. Built on NumPy, SciPy and matplotlib, this library contains a lot of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction.\n\nStatsmodels\u00a0for statistical modeling.\u00a0Statsmodels is a Python module that allows users to explore data, estimate statistical models, and perform statistical tests. An extensive list of descriptive statistics, statistical tests, plotting functions, and result statistics are available for different types of data and each estimator.\n\nSeaborn\u00a0for statistical data visualization.\u00a0Seaborn is a library for making attractive and informative statistical graphics in Python. It is based on matplotlib. Seaborn aims to make visualization a central part of exploring and understanding data.\n\nBokeh\u00a0for creating interactive plots, dashboards and data applications on modern web-browsers.\u00a0It empowers the user to generate elegant and concise graphics in the style of D3.js. Moreover, it has the capability of high-performance interactivity over very large or streaming datasets.\n\nBlaze\u00a0for extending the capability of Numpy and Pandas to distributed and streaming datasets.\u00a0It can be used to access data from a multitude of sources including Bcolz, MongoDB, SQLAlchemy, Apache Spark, PyTables, etc. Together with Bokeh, Blaze can act as a very powerful tool for creating effective visualizations and dashboards on huge chunks of data.\n\nScrapy\u00a0for web crawling. It is a very useful framework for getting specific patterns of data. It has the capability to start at a website home url and then dig through web-pages within the website to gather information.\n\nSymPy\u00a0for symbolic computation. It has wide-ranging capabilities from basic symbolic arithmetic to calculus, algebra, discrete mathematics and quantum physics. Another useful feature is the capability of formatting the result of the computations as LaTeX code.\n\nRequests\u00a0for accessing the web. It works similar to the the standard python library urllib2 but is much easier to code. You will find subtle differences with urllib2 but for beginners, Requests might be more convenient.\n\nAdditional libraries, you might need:\n\nos\u00a0for Operating system and file operations\n\nnetworkx\u00a0and\u00a0igraph\u00a0for graph based data manipulations\n\nregular expressions\u00a0for finding patterns in text data\n\nBeautifulSoup\u00a0for scrapping web. It is inferior to Scrapy as it will extract information from just a single webpage in a run.",

      "text": "Data Science Interview Questions With Answers\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between random forest and gradient boosting?\n\nRandom Forests builds each tree independently while Gradient Boosting builds one tree at a time.\nRandom Forests combine results at the end of the process (by averaging or \"majority rules\") while Gradient Boosting combines results along the way.\n\nWhat happens to our linear regression model if we have three columns in our data: x, y, z \u200a\u2014\u200a and z is a sum of x and y?\n\nWe would not be able to perform the regression. Because z is linearly dependent on x and y so when performing the regression\u00a0 would be a singular (not invertible) matrix.\n\nHow does L2 regularization look like in a linear model?\n\nL2 regularization adds a penalty term to our cost function which is equal to the sum of squares of models coefficients multiplied by a lambda hyperparameter. \n\nThis technique makes sure that the coefficients are close to zero and is widely used in cases when we have a lot of features that might correlate with each other.\n\nWhat are the main parameters in the gradient boosting model?\n\nThere are many parameters, but below are a few key defaults.\n\nlearning_rate=0.1 (shrinkage).\nn_estimators=100 (number of trees).\nmax_depth=3.\nmin_samples_split=2.\nmin_samples_leaf=1.\nsubsample=1.0.\n\nWhat are the main parameters of the random forest model?\n\nmax_depth: Longest Path between root node and the leaf\n\nmin_sample_split: The minimum number of observations needed to split a given node\n\nmax_leaf_nodes: Conditions the splitting of the tree and hence, limits the growth of the trees\n\nmin_samples_leaf: minimum number of samples in the leaf node\n\nn_estimators: Number of trees\n\nmax_sample: Fraction of original dataset given to any individual tree in the given model\n\nmax_features: Limits the maximum number of features provided to trees in random forest model\n\nQuiz Explaination\n\nSupervised Learning: All data is labeled and the algorithms learn to predict the output from the \ninput data\n\nUnsupervised Learning: All data is unlabeled and the algorithms learn to inherent structure from \nthe input data. \n\nSemi-supervised Learning: Some data is labeled but most of it is unlabeled and a mixture of \nsupervised and unsupervised techniques can be used to solve problem.\n\nUnsupervised learning problems can be further grouped into clustering and association problems.\n\nClustering: A clustering problem is where you want to discover the inherent groupings \nin the data, such as grouping customers by purchasing behavior. \n\nAssociation: An association rule learning problem is where you want to discover rules \nthat describe large portions of your data, such as people that buy A also tend to buy B.\n\nWhat is feature selection? Why do we need it? \n\nFeature Selection is a method used to select the relevant features for the model to train on. We need feature selection to remove the irrelevant features which leads the model to under-perform.\n\nWhat are the decision trees? \n\nThis is a type of supervised learning algorithm that is mostly used for classification problems. Surprisingly, it works for both categorical and continuous dependent variables.\n\nIn this algorithm, we split the population into two or more homogeneous sets. This is done based on most significant attributes/ independent variables to make as distinct groups as possible.\n\nA decision tree is a flowchart-like tree structure, where each internal node (non-leaf node) denotes a test on an attribute, each branch represents an outcome of the test, and each leaf node (or terminal node) holds a value for the target variable.\n\nVarious techniques : like Gini, Information Gain, Chi-square, entropy.\n\nWhat are the benefits of a single decision tree compared to more complex models?\n\neasy to implement\nfast training\nfast inference\ngood explainability\n\nWhat are precision, recall, and F1-score? \n\nPrecision and recall are classification evaluation metrics:\nP = TP / (TP + FP) and R = TP / (TP + FN).\n\nWhere TP is true positives, FP is false positives and FN is false negatives",

      "text": "Some important questions to crack data science interview\n\nQ.  Describe how Gradient Boosting works.\n\nA. Gradient boosting is a type of machine learning boosting. It relies on the intuition that the best possible next model, when combined with previous models, minimizes the overall prediction error. If a small change in the prediction for a case causes no change in error, then next target outcome of the case is zero. Gradient boosting produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees.\n\n\nQ. Describe the decision tree model.\n\nA. Decision Trees are a type of Supervised Machine Learning where the data is continuously split according to a certain parameter. The leaves are the decisions or the final outcomes. A decision tree is a machine learning algorithm that partitions the data into subsets. \n\n\nQ. What is a neural network?\n\nA.  Neural networks are a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, that are designed to recognize patterns. They interpret sensory data through a kind of machine perception, labeling or clustering raw input. They, also known as Artificial Neural Networks, are the subset of Deep Learning.\n\n\nQ.  Explain the Bias-Variance Tradeoff\n\nA.  The bias\u2013variance tradeoff is the property of a model that the variance of the parameter estimated across samples can be reduced by increasing the bias in the estimated parameters.\n\n\nQ.  What\u2019s the difference between L1 and L2 regularization?\n\nA.  The main intuitive difference between the L1 and L2 regularization is that L1 regularization tries to estimate the median of the data while the L2 regularization tries to estimate the mean of the data to avoid overfitting. That value will also be the median of the data distribution mathematically.\n\nENJOY LEARNING \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",

INNER JOIN: Returns records with matching values in both tables\n\nSELECT * FROM table1\nINNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;\n\n2. LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table & matched records from the right table. Unmatched records will have NULL values.\n\nSELECT * FROM table1\nLEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;\n\n3. RIGHT JOIN: Returns all records from the right table & matched records from the left table. Unmatched records will have NULL values.\n\nSELECT * FROM table1\nRIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;\n\n4.

Explain Star Schema.\n\nStar schema is a data warehousing concept in which all schema is connected to a central schema.\n\n\n3.  What is root cause analysis?\n\nRoot cause analysis is the process of tracing back of occurrence of an event and the factors which lead to it. It\u2019s generally done when a software malfunctions. In data science, root cause analysis helps businesses understand the semantics behind certain outcomes.\n\n\n4. Define Confounding Variables.\n\nA confounding variable is an external influence in an experiment. In simple words, these variables change the effect of a dependent and independent variable. A variable should satisfy below conditions to be a confounding variable :\n\nVariables should be correlated to the independent variable.\nVariables should be informally related to the dependent variable.\nFor example, if you are studying whether a lack of exercise has an effect on weight gain, then the lack of exercise is an independent variable and weight gain is a dependent variable. A confounder variable can be any other factor that has an effect on weight gain. Amount of food consumed, weather conditions etc. can be a confounding variable.",

      "text": "Hey guys,\n\nToday, let\u2019s talk about SQL conceptual questions that are often asked in data analyst interviews. These questions test not only your technical skills but also your conceptual understanding of SQL and its real-world applications. \n\n1. What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL?\n\n- SQL (Structured Query Language) is a relational database management system, meaning it uses tables (rows and columns) to store data. \n- NoSQL databases, on the other hand, handle unstructured data and don\u2019t rely on a schema, making them more flexible in terms of data storage and retrieval.  \n- Interview Tip: Don't just memorize definitions. Be prepared to explain scenarios where you\u2019d use SQL over NoSQL, and vice versa.\n\n2. What is the difference between INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN?\n\n- An INNER JOIN returns records that have matching values in both tables.\n- An OUTER JOIN returns all records from one table and the matched records from the second table. If there's no match, NULL values are returned.\n\n3. How do you optimize a SQL query for better performance?\n\n- Indexing: Create indexes on columns used frequently in WHERE, JOIN, or GROUP BY clauses.\n- Query optimization: Use appropriate WHERE clauses to reduce the data set and avoid unnecessary calculations.\n- Avoid SELECT *: Always specify the columns you need to reduce the amount of data retrieved.\n- Limit results: If you only need a subset of the data, use the LIMIT clause.\n\n4. What are the different types of SQL constraints?\n\nConstraints are used to enforce rules on data in a table. They ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data. The most common types are:\n\n- PRIMARY KEY: Ensures each record is unique and not null.\n- FOREIGN KEY: Enforces a relationship between two tables.\n- UNIQUE: Ensures all values in a column are unique.\n- NOT NULL: Prevents NULL values from being entered into a column.\n- CHECK: Ensures a column's values meet a specific condition.\n\n5. What is normalization? What are the different normal forms?\n\nNormalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. Here\u2019s a quick overview of normal forms:\n\n- 1NF (First Normal Form): Ensures that all values in a table are atomic (indivisible).\n- 2NF (Second Normal Form): Ensures that the table is in 1NF and that all non-key columns are fully dependent on the primary key.\n- 3NF (Third Normal Form): Ensures that the table is in 2NF and all columns are independent of each other except for the primary key.\n\n6. What is a subquery?\n\nA subquery is a query within another query. It's used to perform operations that need intermediate results before generating the final query. \n\nExample:\nSELECT employee_id, name\nFROM employees\nWHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);\nIn this case, the subquery calculates the average salary, and the outer query selects employees whose salary is greater than the average.\n\n7. What is the difference between a UNION and a UNION ALL?\n\n- UNION combines the result sets of two SELECT statements and removes duplicates.\n- UNION ALL combines the result sets and includes duplicates.\n\n8. What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING clause?\n\n- WHERE filters rows before any groupings are made. It\u2019s used with SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements.\n- HAVING filters groups after the GROUP BY clause.\n\n9. How would you handle NULL values in SQL?\n\nNULL values can represent missing or unknown data. Here\u2019s how to manage them:\n\n- Use IS NULL or IS NOT NULL in WHERE clauses to filter null values.\n- Use COALESCE() or IFNULL() to replace NULL values with default ones.\n\nExample:\nSELECT name, COALESCE(age, 0) AS age\nFROM employees;\n\n10. What is the purpose of the GROUP BY clause?\n\nThe GROUP BY clause groups rows with the same values into summary rows. It\u2019s often used with aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.\n\nExample:\nSELECT department, COUNT(*)\nFROM employees\nGROUP BY department;",

      "text": "Data Analytics Interview Preparation \n[Questions with Answers]\n\nHow did you get your job?\n\nI was hired after an internship.\u00a0 \nTo get the internship, I prepared a bunch for general Python questions (LeetCode etc.) and studied the basics of machine learning (several different algorithms, how they work, when they're useful, metrics\u00a0 \nto measure their performance, how to train them in practice etc.).\u00a0 \n\nTo get the internship I had to pass a technical interview as well as a take-home machine learning (ML) exercise. Then, it was just a question of doing a good job in the internship!\u00a0 \n\nWhat are your data related responsibilities in your job?\u00a0 \n\nI work on our recommendation system. It\u2019s deep learning based. I work on a lot of features to try and\u00a0 \nimprove it (reinforcement learning & NLP etc). Since I'm in a start-up, it's also up to our team to put the models we design into production. So, after a phase of research & development and model design, in notebooks, it's time to create a real pipeline, by creating scripts.\u00a0 \nThis enables us to define, train, replace, compare and check the status of the models in production. It's basically all in Python, using Keras/TensorFlow, Pandas, Scikit-learn and NumPy. We also do a lot of analysis for the business team to help them compute metrics of interest (related to\u00a0 \nrevenue, acquisition etc.). For that, we use an external utility called Metabase. It is is hooked up to our database where we write SQL queries and visualize the results and create dashboards (using\u00a0 \nTableau/Looker etc).\u00a0 \nI would say my role is quite \"full-stack\" since we are all involved from the phase of R&D to deployment on our cluster.\u00a0 \n\nWas it difficult to get this role? \n\nI got hired after an internship. If you come from a scientific background, it's not that hard to transition into data science. All the math is something you will probably have seen already (especially if you're\u00a0 \ndoing maths or physics). So, with some preparation and coding practice, you can start applying to internships.\u00a0 \nIt took me maybe a month or two of preparation to get some basic ideas of the typical Python data stack (Pandas, Keras, SciKit-learn etc) before I started to send out CVs. Then, if you get an internship, try your best to do the best you can and then maybe you'll be hired after!",

      "text": "Creating a data science and machine learning project involves several steps, from defining the problem to deploying the model. Here is a general outline of how you can create a data science and ML project:\n\n1. Define the Problem: Start by clearly defining the problem you want to solve. Understand the business context, the goals of the project, and what insights or predictions you aim to derive from the data.\n\n2. Collect Data: Gather relevant data that will help you address the problem. This could involve collecting data from various sources, such as databases, APIs, CSV files, or web scraping.\n\n3. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for analysis and modeling. This may involve handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features, and other data cleaning tasks.\n\n4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the data better. Visualize the data, identify patterns, correlations, and outliers that may impact your analysis.\n\n5. Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing features to improve the performance of your machine learning model. Feature engineering is crucial for building a successful ML model.\n\n6. Model Selection: Choose the appropriate machine learning algorithm based on the problem you are trying to solve (classification, regression, clustering, etc.). Experiment with different models and hyperparameters to find the best-performing one.\n\n7. Model Training: Split your data into training and testing sets and train your machine learning model on the training data. Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using appropriate metrics.\n\n8. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of your model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, etc. Make sure to analyze the results and iterate on your model if needed.\n\n9. Deployment: Once you have a satisfactory model, deploy it into production. This could involve creating an API for real-time predictions, integrating it into a web application, or any other method of making your model accessible.\n\n10. Monitoring and Maintenance: Monitor the performance of your deployed model and ensure that it continues to perform well over time. Update the model as needed based on new data or changes in the problem domain.",

      "text": "COMMON TERMINOLOGIES IN PYTHON - PART 1\n\nHave you ever gotten into a discussion with a programmer before? Did you find some of the Terminologies mentioned strange or you didn't fully understand them?\n\nIn this series, we would be looking at the common Terminologies in python.\n\nIt is important to know these Terminologies to be able to professionally/properly explain your codes to people and/or to be able to understand what people say in an instant when these codes are mentioned. Below are a few:\n\nIDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment) - this is an environment that allows you to easily write Python code. IDLE can be used to execute a single statements and create, modify, and execute Python scripts.\n\nPython Shell - This is the interactive environment that allows you to type in python code and execute them immediately \n\nSystem Python - This is the version of python that comes with your operating system \n\nPrompt - usually represented by the symbol \">>>\" and it simply means that python is waiting for you to give it some instructions\n\nREPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop) - this refers to the sequence of events in your interactive window in form of a loop (python reads the code inputted>the code is evaluated>output is printed)\n\nArgument - this is a value that is passed to a function when called eg print(\"Hello World\")... \"Hello World\" is the argument that is being passed.\n\nFunction - this is a code that takes some input, known as arguments, processes that input and produces an output called a return value. E.g print(\"Hello World\")... print is the function \n\nReturn Value - this is the value that a function returns to the calling script or function when it completes its task (in other words, Output). E.g.\n>>> print(\"Hello World\")\nHello World \nWhere Hello World is your return value.\n\nNote: A return value can be any of these variable types: handle, integer, object, or string\n\nScript - This is a file where you store your python code in a text file and execute all of the code with a single command \n\nScript files - this is a file containing a group of python scripts",

You import or connect to data, transform it, and then store it in a dataset within Power BI.\n\n2. Report: Reports visualize data from your dataset. They consist of visuals like charts, graphs, tables, etc., created using the data in your dataset. Reports allow you to explore and analyze your data in depth.\n\n3. Dashboard: Dashboards are a collection of visuals from one or more reports, designed to give a snapshot view of your data. They provide a high-level overview of key metrics and trends. You can pin visuals from different reports onto a dashboard to create a unified view.\n\nI have curated the best interview resources to crack Power BI Interviews \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\nhttps://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Vai1xKf1dAvuk6s1v22c\n\nHope you'll like it \n\nLike this post if you need more resources like this \ud83d\udc4d\u2764\ufe0f",

      "text": "20 Must-Know Statistics Questions for Data Analyst and Business Analyst Roles (With Detailed Answers)\n\n1. What is the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics?\n\nDescriptive statistics summarize and organize data (e.g., mean, median, mode).\n\nInferential statistics make predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample (e.g., hypothesis testing, confidence intervals).\n\n\n2. Explain mean, median, and mode and when to use each.\n\nMean is the average; use when data is symmetrically distributed.\n\nMedian is the middle value; best when data has outliers.\n\nMode is the most frequent value; useful for categorical data.\n\n\n3. What is standard deviation, and why is it important?\n\nIt measures data spread around the mean. A low value = less variability; high value = more spread. Important for understanding consistency and risk.\n\n\n4. Define correlation vs. causation with examples.\n\nCorrelation: Two variables move together but don't cause each other (e.g., ice cream sales and drowning).\n\nCausation: One variable directly affects another (e.g., smoking causes lung cancer).\n\n\n5. What is a p-value, and how do you interpret it?\n\nP-value measures the probability of observing results given that the null hypothesis is true. A small p-value (typically < 0.05) suggests rejecting the null.\n\n\n6. Explain the concept of confidence intervals.\n\nA range of values used to estimate a population parameter. A 95% CI means there's a 95% chance the true value falls within the range.\n\n\n7. What are outliers, and how can you handle them?\n\nOutliers are extreme values differing significantly from others. Handle using:\n\nRemoval (if due to error)\n\nTransformation\n\nCapping (e.g., winsorizing)\n\n\n\n8. When would you use a t-test vs. a z-test?\n\nT-test: Small samples (n < 30) and unknown population standard deviation.\n\nZ-test: Large samples and known standard deviation.\n\n\n9. What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and why is it important?\n\nCLT states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as sample size grows, regardless of population distribution. Essential for inference.\n\n\n10. Explain the difference between population and sample.\n\nPopulation: Entire group of interest.\n\nSample: Subset used for analysis. Inference is made from the sample to the population.\n\n\n11. What is regression analysis, and what are its key assumptions?\n\nPredicts a dependent variable using one or more independent variables.\n\nAssumptions: Linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, no multicollinearity, normality of residuals.\n\n\n12. How do you calculate probability, and why does it matter in analytics?\n\nProbability = (Favorable outcomes) / (Total outcomes).\n\nCritical for risk estimation, decision-making, and predictions.\n\n\n13. Explain the concept of Bayes\u2019 Theorem with a practical example.\n\nBayes\u2019 updates the probability of an event based on new evidence:\n\nP(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)\n\n\nExample: Calculating disease probability given a positive test result.\n\n\n14. What is an ANOVA test, and when should it be used?\n\nANOVA (Analysis of Variance) compares means across 3+ groups to see if at least one differs.\n\nUse when comparing more than two groups.\n\n\n15. Define skewness and kurtosis in a dataset.\n\nSkewness: Measure of asymmetry (positive = right-skewed, negative = left).\n\nKurtosis: Measure of tail thickness (high kurtosis = heavy tails, outliers).\n\n\n16. What is the difference between parametric and non-parametric tests?\n\nParametric: Assumes data follows a distribution (e.g., t-test).\n\nNon-parametric: No assumptions; use with skewed or ordinal data (e.g., Mann-Whitney U).\n\n\n17. What are Type I and Type II errors in hypothesis testing?\n\nType I error: False positive (rejecting a true null).\n\nType II error: False negative (failing to reject a false null).\n\n\n18. How do you handle missing data in a dataset?\n\nMethods:\n\nDeletion (listwise or pairwise)\n\nImputation (mean, median, mode, regression)\n\nAdvanced: KNN, MICE",

      "text": "SQL interview questions with answers \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\udc47\n\n1. Question: What is SQL?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Answer: SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. It is used to query, insert, update, and delete data in databases.\n\n2. Question: Differentiate between SQL and MySQL.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Answer: SQL is a language for managing relational databases, while MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL as its language.\n\n3. Question: Explain the difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Answer: INNER JOIN returns rows when there is a match in both tables, while LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table and the matched rows from the right table, filling in with NULLs for non-matching rows.\n\n4. Question: How do you remove duplicate records from a table?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Answer: Use the DISTINCT keyword in a SELECT statement to retrieve unique records. For example: SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2 FROM table;\n\n5. Question: What is a subquery in SQL?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Answer: A subquery is a query nested inside another query. It can be used to retrieve data that will be used in the main query as a condition to further restrict the data to be retrieved.\n\n6. Question: Explain the purpose of the GROUP BY clause.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Answer: The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows, like when using aggregate functions such as COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.\n\n7. Question: How can you add a new record to a table?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Answer: Use the INSERT INTO statement. For example: INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2);\n\n8. Question: What is the purpose of the HAVING clause?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Answer: The HAVING clause is used in combination with the GROUP BY clause to filter the results of aggregate functions based on a specified condition.\n\n9. Question: Explain the concept of normalization in databases.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Answer: Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves breaking down tables into smaller, related tables.\n\n10. Question: How do you update data in a table in SQL?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Answer: Use the UPDATE statement to modify existing records in a table. For example: UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1 WHERE condition;",

It\u2019s fundamental.\n\nHere\u2019s a concise guide to the most important join types, with real-world use cases:\n\n\nINNER JOIN\n\nReturns records with matching keys from both tables.\nUse case: Show only customers who\u2019ve placed at least one order.\n\n\nLEFT JOIN (OUTER)\n\nReturns all rows from the left table, and matched rows from the right.\nUse case: List all customers, including those with zero orders.\n\n\nRIGHT JOIN (OUTER)\n\nReturns all rows from the right table. Rarely used, but powerful.\nUse case: Show all orders, even if the customer was deleted.\n\n\nFULL OUTER JOIN\n\nReturns all records from both tables.\nUse case: Capture everything \u2014 matched and unmatched.\n\n\nCROSS JOIN\n\nReturns the cartesian product.\nUse case: Generate every possible product/supplier combo.\n\n\nSELF JOIN\n\nJoins a table to itself.\nUse case: Show employees and their reporting managers.\n\n\nBest Practices\n\nUse aliases (A, B) for clean code\nPrefer JOIN ON over WHERE for clarity\nAlways test joins with LIMIT to prevent overloads",

      "text": "The Data Science skill no one talks about...\n\nEvery aspiring data scientist I talk to thinks their job starts when someone else gives them:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1. a dataset, and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2. a clearly defined metric to optimize for, e.g. accuracy\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t.\n\nIt starts with a business problem you need to understand, frame, and solve. This is the key data science skill that separates senior from junior professionals.\n\nLet\u2019s go through an example.\n\nExample\n\nImagine you are a data scientist at Uber. And your product lead tells you:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udcbc: \u201cWe want to decrease user churn by 5% this quarter\u201d\n\nWe say that a user churns when she decides to stop using Uber.\n\nBut why?\n\nThere are different reasons why a user would stop using Uber. For example:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 1.\u00a0 \u201cLyft is offering better prices for that geo\u201d (pricing problem)\n\u00a0\u00a0 2. \u201cCar waiting times are too long\u201d (supply problem)\n\u00a0\u00a0 3. \u201cThe Android version of the app is very slow\u201d (client-app performance problem)\n\nYou build this list \u2191 by asking the right questions to the rest of the team. You need to understand the user\u2019s experience using the app, from HER point of view.\n\nTypically there is no single reason behind churn, but a combination of a few of these. The question is: which one should you focus on?\n\nThis is when you pull out your great data science skills and EXPLORE THE DATA \ud83d\udd0e.\n\nYou explore the data to understand how plausible each of the above explanations is. The output from this analysis is a single hypothesis you should consider further. Depending on the hypothesis, you will solve the data science problem differently.\n\nFor example\u2026\n\nScenario 1: \u201cLyft Is Offering Better Prices\u201d (Pricing Problem)\n\nOne solution would be to detect/predict the segment of users who are likely to churn (possibly using an ML Model) and send personalized discounts via push notifications. To test your solution works, you will need to run an A/B test, so you will split a percentage of Uber users into 2 groups:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The A group. No user in this group will receive any discount.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The B group. Users from this group that the model thinks are likely to churn, will receive a price discount in their next trip.\n\nYou could add more groups (e.g. C, D, E\u2026) to test different pricing points.\n\nIn a nutshell\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1. Translating business problems into data science problems is the key data science skill that separates a senior from a junior data scientist.\n2. Ask the right questions, list possible solutions, and explore the data to narrow down the list to one.\n3. Solve this one data science problem",

What is a Dataset?\n\n\u2022 A dataset is a structured collection of data, usually organized in rows and columns, used for analysis or training machine learning models.\n\n2. Types of Datasets\n\n\u2022 Structured Data: Tables, spreadsheets with rows and columns (e.g., CSV, Excel).\n\n\u2022 Unstructured Data: Images, text, audio, video.\n\n\u2022 Semi-structured Data: JSON, XML files containing hierarchical data.\n\n3. Common Dataset Formats\n\n\u2022 CSV (Comma-Separated Values)\n\n\u2022 Excel (.xls, .xlsx)\n\n\u2022 JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)\n\n\u2022 XML (eXtensible Markup Language)\n\n\u2022 Images (JPEG, PNG, TIFF)\n\n\u2022 Audio (WAV, MP3)\n\n\n4. Loading Datasets in Python\n\n\u2022 Use libraries like pandas for structured data:\n\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\n\n\u2022 Use libraries like json for JSON files:\n\nimport json\nwith open('data.json') as f:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 data = json.load(f)\n\n\n5. Basic Dataset Exploration\n\n\u2022 Check shape and size:\n\nprint(df.shape)\n\n\u2022 Preview data:\n\nprint(df.head())\n\n\u2022 Check for missing values:\n\nprint(df.isnull().sum())\n\n\n6. Summary\n\n\u2022 Understanding dataset types is crucial before processing.\n\n\u2022 Loading and exploring datasets helps identify cleaning and preprocessing needs.\n\n\nExercise\n\n\u2022 Load a CSV and JSON dataset in Python, print their shapes, and identify missing values.\n\n#DataScience #Datasets #DataLoading #Python #DataExploration",

      "text": "SQL Basics for Beginners: Must-Know Concepts\n\n1. What is SQL?  \n   SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used to communicate with databases. It allows you to query, update, and manage relational databases by writing simple or complex queries.\n\n2. SQL Syntax  \n   SQL is written using statements, which consist of keywords like SELECT, FROM, WHERE, etc., to perform operations on the data.\n   - SQL keywords are not case-sensitive, but it's common to write them in uppercase (e.g., SELECT, FROM).\n\n3. SQL Data Types  \n   Databases store data in different formats. The most common data types are:\n   - INT (Integer): For whole numbers.\n   - VARCHAR(n) or TEXT: For storing text data.\n   - DATE: For dates.\n   - DECIMAL: For precise decimal values, often used in financial calculations.\n\n4. Basic SQL Queries  \n   Here are some fundamental SQL operations:\n\n   - SELECT Statement: Used to retrieve data from a database.\n    \n     SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;\n     \n   - WHERE Clause: Filters data based on conditions.\n    \n     SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition;\n     \n   - ORDER BY: Sorts data in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.\n    \n     SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name ORDER BY column1 ASC;\n     \n   - LIMIT: Limits the number of rows returned.\n    \n     SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT 5;\n     \n5. Filtering Data with WHERE Clause  \n   The WHERE clause helps you filter data based on a condition:\n  \n   SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;\n   \n   You can use comparison operators like:\n   - =: Equal to\n   - >: Greater than\n   - <: Less than\n   - LIKE: For pattern matching\n\n6. Aggregating Data  \n   SQL provides functions to summarize or aggregate data:\n   - COUNT(): Counts the number of rows.\n    \n     SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name;\n     \n   - SUM(): Adds up values in a column.\n    \n     SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employees;\n     \n   - AVG(): Calculates the average value.\n    \n     SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;\n     \n   - GROUP BY: Groups rows that have the same values into summary rows.\n    \n     SELECT department, AVG(salary) FROM employees GROUP BY department;\n     \n7. Joins in SQL  \n   Joins combine data from two or more tables:\n   - INNER JOIN: Retrieves records with matching values in both tables.\n    \n     SELECT employees.name, departments.department\n     FROM employees\n     INNER JOIN departments\n     ON employees.department_id = departments.id;\n     \n   - LEFT JOIN: Retrieves all records from the left table and matched records from the right table.\n    \n     SELECT employees.name, departments.department\n     FROM employees\n     LEFT JOIN departments\n     ON employees.department_id = departments.id;\n     \n8. Inserting Data\n   To add new data to a table, you use the INSERT INTO statement:\n  \n   INSERT INTO employees (name, position, salary) VALUES ('John Doe', 'Analyst', 60000);\n   \n9. Updating Data\n   You can update existing data in a table using the UPDATE statement:\n  \n   UPDATE employees SET salary = 65000 WHERE name = 'John Doe';\n   \n10. Deleting Data\n    To remove data from a table, use the DELETE statement:\n   \n    DELETE FROM employees WHERE name = 'John Doe';\n    \n\nHere you can find essential SQL Interview Resources\ud83d\udc47\nhttps://t.me/DataSimplifier\n\nLike this post if you need more \ud83d\udc4d\u2764\ufe0f \n\nHope it helps :)",
